      <h1>Teach X in Y Minutes</h1>

      <p class="grey">This tutorial doesn't assume any existing knowledge in X.</p>
  
      <h2>Before We Start</h2>
  
      <p>This website provides a template for making tutorials in a format that is easily monetized and enables self-interested growth. Low barrier to entry, high user engagement, no expertise required. Follow these simple steps and you'll have thousands of readers in no time!</p>

      <p>In this tutorial, we will be creating a tutorial for a popular web framework: <a href="https://reactjs.org/">ReactJS</a>. <strong>You might have your doubts considering how React is totally a 2019 framework and everybody uses <a href="http://vanilla-js.com/">VanillaJS</a> in 2020 -- but give it a chance</strong>. The fundamentals covered here will carry over to all your clout chasing endeavours.</p>
  
      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Tip</strong></p>
        <p>Everyone knows the best way to learn is by doing. So make sure to follow along and build your own React tutorial as we go, the search space is definitely not over saturated and one more generic tutorial won't hurt.</p>
      </blockquote>
  
      <p>This tutorial is divided into several sections:</p>
  
      <ul>
        <li><a href="#inspiration-and-motivation">Inspiration and Motivation</a></li>
        <li><a href="#setup-for-the-tutorial">Setup for the Tutorial</a></li>
        <li><a href="#call-to-action">Call to Action</a></li>
      </ul>
  
      <p>Don't worry about completing all sections at once, there's valuable information in each one!</p>
  
      <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
  
      <p>No expertise on React is required in order to make your tutorial. Make sure your medium blog is set up to post the tutorial when you're done. Bonus points if you already have a mailing list created and a YouTube channel you can post a video version of you rewritting your previously made project to once you're done.</p>
  
      <h2 id="inspiration-and-motivation">Inspiration and Motivation</h2>
  
      <p>These days everyone wants to be a programmer. The social media algorithms have decided content focused on new learners. People want to know what the secret is to the success of all the giant tech companines they've heard so much about. How did Steve Jobs get so good at making iPhones? Where did Elon Musk learn rocket science? New programmers are scouring the internet for the one silver bullet that will solve all their struggles with learning all the languages, frameworks, technologies, algorithms, ... that they need to know in order to make thier sweet six figure salary in silicon valley.</p>
  
      <p>This is where you come in. Generic, quick, and non-technical tutorials that teach x in y minutes are perfect for claiming your piece of the pie in the game of farming algorithm driven clicks.</p>
  
      <h2 id="setup-for-the-tutorial">Setup for the Tutorial</h2>
  
      <p>Obtain the minimal required knowledge of whatever technology you'll be writing about. Use a majority of your time pretending to research trends in the latest frameworks and figure out what your readers will want to learn most. <strong>At maximum, spend one afternoon hacking up the actual code.</strong> Ensure to leave a detailed comment explaining each line of code to further appeal to your audience, or more prefferably, write no comments at all. Write everything using Linux because while your readers will primarily be on Windows, Linux will make you look like the hacker everyone wants to be.</p>
  
      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Tip</strong></p>
        <p>If you have no experience with Linux, just preface all your terminal commands with `sudo`</p>
      </blockquote>
  
      <h2>Help I'm Stuck</h2>
  
      <p>If you get stuck, google React tutorials and copy the first one you see. Make some small tweaks and change the title to the most recent release verison to attract newer readers. Provide no attribution to the original authors.</p>
  
      <h2 id="call-to-action">Call to Action</h2>
  
      <p>Now that you've written your tutorial for ReactJs, it's time to cash in on what we're really here for, user engagement and passive income.</p>
  
      <p>Include links to at least 3 of the following at the bottom of the page:</p>
  
      <ul>
        <li>Patreon</li>
        <li>OnlyFaangs</li>
        <li>Mailing List</li>
        <li>Referral links</li>
