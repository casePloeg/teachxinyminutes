      <h1>Teach X in Y Minutes</h1>

      <p class="grey">This tutorial doesn't assume any existing knowledge in X.</p>
  
      <h2>Before We Start</h2>
  
      <p>This website provides a template for making tutorials in a format that is easily monetized and enables self-interested growth. Low barrier to entry, high user engagement, no expertise required. Follow these simple steps and you'll have thousands of readers in no time!</p>

      <p>In this tutorial, we will be creating a tutorial for a popular web framework: <a href="https://reactjs.org/">ReactJS</a>. <strong>You might have your doubts considering how React is totally a 2019 framework and everybody uses <a href="http://vanilla-js.com/">VanillaJS</a> in 2020 -- but give it a chance</strong>. The fundamentals covered here will carry over to all your clout chasing endeavours.</p>
  
      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Tip</strong></p>
        <p>Everyone knows the best way to learn is by doing. So make sure to follow along and build your own React tutorial as we go, the search space is definitely not over saturated and one more generic tutorial won't hurt.</p>
      </blockquote>
  
      <p>This tutorial is divided into several sections:</p>
  
      <ul>
        <li><a href="#inspiration-and-motivation">Inspiration and Motivation</a></li>
        <li><a href="#setup-for-the-tutorial">Setup for the Tutorial</a></li>
        <li><a href="#call-to-action">Call to Action</a></li>
      </ul>
  
      <p>Don't worry about completing all sections at once, there's valuable information in each one!</p>
  
      <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
  
      <p>No expertise in React is required in order to make your tutorial. Just ensure your Medium blog is set up to post the tutorial once you're done. Bonus points if you already have a mailing list created and a YouTube channel you can post a video version to.</p>
  
      <h2 id="inspiration-and-motivation">Inspiration and Motivation</h2>
  
      <p>These days everyone wants to be a programmer. The social media algorithms have decided content focused on new learners is exciting and advertiser friendly. People want to know what the secret is to the success of all the giant tech companines they've heard so much about. How did Steve Jobs get so good at making iPhones? Where did Elon Musk learn rocket science? New programmers are scouring the internet for the one silver bullet that will solve all their struggles with learning languages, frameworks, technologies, algorithms and everything else that's keeping them from a sweet six figure salary in silicon valley.</p>
  
      <p>This is where you come in. Generic, quick, and non-technical tutorials that <strong>teach x in y minutes</strong> are perfect for claiming your piece of the pie in the game of farming algorithm driven clicks.</p>
  
      <h2 id="setup-for-the-tutorial">Setup for the Tutorial</h2>
  
      <p>Obtain the minimal required knowledge of whatever technology you'll be writing about. Use the majority of your time pretending to research trends in the latest technology and figure out what your readers will want to learn most. <strong>At maximum, spend one afternoon hacking up the actual code.</strong> Write everything using Linux because while your readers will primarily be on Windows, Linux will make you look like the hacker everyone wants to be.</p>
  
      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Tip</strong></p>
        <p>If you have no experience with Linux, just preface all your terminal commands with `sudo`</p>
      </blockquote>
  
      <h2>Help I'm Stuck</h2>
  
      <p>If you get stuck, google React tutorials and copy the first one you see. Make some small tweaks and change the title to the most recent release verison to attract newer readers. Provide no attribution to the original authors. <strong>This website is definitely not a copy of the <a href="https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html">official ReactJS tutorial</a> or of <a href="https://learnxinyminutes.com/">learnxinyminutes.com</a>.</strong></p>
  
      <h2 id="call-to-action">Call to Action</h2>
  
      <p>Now that you've written your tutorial for ReactJS, it's time to cash in on what we're really here for: user engagement and passive income.</p>
  
      <p>Include links to at least 3 of the following at the bottom of the page:</p>
  
      <ul>
        <li>Patreon</li>
        <li>OnlyFaangs</li>
        <li>Mailing List</li>
        <li>Referral links</li>
        <li>Bitcoin wallet</li>
        <li>Twitter</li>
        <li>LinkedIn</li>
        <li>YouTube</li>
        <li>Github repo</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h2>Wrapping Up</h2>
  
      <p>Congrats! You're officially a tech guru, rockstar developer, contributor to the open source community, and entrepreneur. Go forth and build a following that advertisers will love and so will your wallet.</p>

            I think that it's extraordinarily important that we in computer science keep fun in computing. When it started out, it was an awful lot of fun. Of course, the paying customers got shafted every now and then, and after a while we began to take their complaints seriously. We began to feel as if we really were responsible for the successful, error-free perfect use of these machines. I don't think we are. I think we're responsible for stretching them, setting them off in new directions, and keeping fun in the house. I hope the field of computer science never loses its sense of fun. Above all, I hope we don't become missionaries. Don't feel as if you're Bible salesmen. The world has too many of those already. What you know about computing other people will learn. Don't feel as if the key to successful computing is only in your hands. What's in your hands, I think and hope, is intelligence: the ability to see the machine as more than when you were first led up to it, that you can make it more.
